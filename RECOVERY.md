# Recovering the missing feature work

The repository's history currently contains only two commits:

```
$ git log --oneline
fa06544 Restore baseline and scaffold navigation routes
Eb4d993 New
```

Running `git reflog` shows that the branch was renamed and immediately reset back to the baseline before the `Restore baseline...` commit was created. There are no additional commits in the reflog, which means the detailed feature work from earlier sessions no longer exists in the local Git database.

```
$ git reflog
fa06544 (HEAD -> work) HEAD@{0}: commit: Restore baseline and scaffold navigation routes
Eb4d993 HEAD@{1}: checkout: moving from old_work-1761440178 to work
```

Because those commits were removed rather than reverted, they can only be recovered if they still exist on another clone or on the remote server. To try recovering them:

1. Check GitHub (or any other remote) for branches or pull requests that contain the desired commits. If you find them, create a new branch from the last good commit and push it back to this repository.
2. Ask any collaborators who might have a local clone from earlier in the day to push their copy of the branch. Git preserves the full history there even if it was rewritten here.
3. If neither of those options is available, the commits have been garbage-collected and cannot be restored. You would need to redo the work manually.

Unfortunately, with only the current repository data, there is no way to recover the removed files.
